 - [ ] Implement translation of RustSec `yanked` to OSV `withdrawn`
 - [x] Implement pre-release version increment logic
 - [ ] Validate the JSON we export against the schema once that's available
 - [ ] Support even more semver operators in version specification? Current DB is covered but we could also support weird stuff like `~`
 - [ ] CI job to export to OSV continously
 - [ ] Make OSV export an optional feature
